It's kind of an odd feature because you'd want it to be local (so nobody else can break your css), but then you might also want it to be distributed because in the absence of that many things might not render correctly.\r\n\r\nEasy to implement... make a project-specific resource directory that can serve public files.  These can then be javascript, css, or static files.  By default this would be under the gitgo directory, but in a multi-server environment it could be in a shared location.\r\n","state":"open"}
