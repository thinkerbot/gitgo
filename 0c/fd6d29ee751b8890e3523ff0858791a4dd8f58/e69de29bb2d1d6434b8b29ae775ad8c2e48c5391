This can be accomplished with a multi-server middleware that routes to sub-servers initialized to various repos.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* inheritance of server-wide configurations (ex resource dir)\r\n* expiration/shutdown of untouched servers\r\n\r\nYou could use a similar management/daemonization model as CI, or keep all the instances as one.  The former is more robust but requires significantly more development, and overhead because many rubies will be needed.","state":"open"}
