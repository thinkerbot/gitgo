=========

Use the file system to describe the graph:

    A/B (B) # edge, link
    A/B (A) # edge, update
    A/A (A) # vertex, delete

Additionally store each object again as the graph cannot be relied upon to keep references to all objects.

    type/A

Print the tree to list the graph data. Tsort to order properly.
