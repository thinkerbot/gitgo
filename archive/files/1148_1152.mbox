This might rather be a call for a git derivative.

As Linus has already mentioned in this thread, git is optimized for his need
for local speed.  But while sacrificing local speed for network speed would
break git by stepping away from the git philosophy, a gitling with a
different philosophy but making use of gitish techniques could make that
change without being broken even though git itself can't.

I downloaded git-pasky 0.6.2.  I cannot compile it because my zlib

wasn't introduced until zlib version 1.2.x  Is there a patch out there 
to work around this and maybe conditionally compile based on the zlib

I apologize in advance if this has already been asked, I cannot find an

I just pushed out this very useful thing to "checkout-cache", which is 
best just described by its commit log:

  Add the ability to prefix something to the pathname to "checkout-cache.c"
  
  This basically makes it trivial to use checkout-cache as a "export as
  tree" function. Just read the desired tree into the index, and do a
  
        checkout-cache --prefix=export-dir/ -a
  
  and checkout-cache will "export" the cache into the specified directory.
  
  NOTE! The final "/" is important. The exported name is literally just
  prefixed with the specified string, so you can also do something like
  
        checkout-cache --prefix=.merged- Makefile
  
  to check out the currently cached copy of "Makefile" into the file
  ".merged-Makefile".

Basically, I can do a a "git-0.6" release with a simple

	checkout-cache --prefix=../git-0.6/ -a

which basically says: check out all files, but use the prefix 
"../git-0.6/" before the filename when you do so.

Then I just do

	cd ..
	tar czvf git-0.6.tar.gz git-0.6

and I'm done. Very cool, very simple, and _extremely_ fast.

Doing the tree export (not the tar) for the whole kernel takes two minutes
in the cold-cache case (not so wonderful, but acceptable), and 4.6
_seconds_ in the hot-cache case (pretty damn impressive, I say).

(The compressng tar then takes about 20 seconds for me, and that's
obviously all from the cache, since I just wrote it out).

NOTE! The fact that the '/' at the end of the --prefix= thing is 
meaningful can be very confusing, I freely admit. But it does end up being 
potentially quite useful, and you're likely to script usage of this anyway 
into "git export" or something, so...

This checkin goes along with the previous one, and makes it easier to use 
all the normal git operations on temporary index files:

  Add support for a "GIT_INDEX_FILE" environment variable.
  
  We use that to specify alternative index files, which can be useful
  if you want to (for example) generate a temporary index file to do
  some specific operation that you don't want to mess with your main
  one with.
  
  It defaults to the regular ".git/index" if it hasn't been specified.

and it's particularly useful for doing things like "read a tree into a 
temporary index file, and write the result out". For example, say that you 
wanted to know what the Makefile looked like in a particular release, 
you could do

    GIT_INDEX_FILE=.tmp-index read-tree $release
    GIT_INDEX_FILE=.tmp-index checkout-cache --prefix=old- Makefile
    rm .tmp-index

and you're done. Your old Makefile version is now in "old-Makefile" (and
this is also where it's nice that checkout-cache refuses to overwrite
existing files by default: if you forgot or messed up the prefix, it's all
good).

You can also use it to test merges without screwing up your old index file 
in case something goes wrong.

Did I already happen to mention that I think that the git model is the
best model ever, and that I'm just not an incredibly good-looking hunk and
becomingly modest, I'm smart too?
