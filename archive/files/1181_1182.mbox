I've just integrated the Mozilla SHA1 library implementation that Adgar
Toernig sent me into the standard git archive (but I did the integration
differently).

The Mozilla SHA1 code is copyright Paul Kocher and Cryptography Research,
and is released under a dual MPL/GPL license. Git obviously uses it in the
GPL version, but I left the MPL choice there too, so that those two files
(that are in a subdirectory of its own) will continue to be dual-licensed.

NOTE! I left git using the openssl libraries by default, and this is a
built-time choice in the makefile. You can choose the Mozilla SHA1
implementation by doing

	make clean
	MOZILLA_SHA1=1 make
	make install

but I suspect that anybody that has openssl installed and is working on an
x86 is much better off with the i586-optimized openssl version. But if you
don't have openssl by default, or if you don't like openssl for some other
reason, you now have a nice easy choice.

Interestingly, the Mozilla SHA1 code is about twice as fast as the openssl
code on my G5, and judging by the disassembly, it's because it's much
simpler. I think the openssl people have unrolled all the loops totally,
which tends to be a disaster on any half-way modern CPU. But hey, it could
be something as simple as optimization flags too.

In the transition from git-0.04 to git-0.5 (Linus' track) the naming 
convention of files in the object database has been changed: a file's 
name passed from the sha1 of its contents to the sha1 of its contents 
*before* compression.

This change was preceded by a long discussion hence both conventions
have arguments for and against.

I would like to suggest to adopt a more versatile solution:

   preserve the pure sha1 based names for the sha1 sum of the file's
   contents. I mean,

       (*)  for files with name xy/z{38} their sha1 sum is xyz{38}

   allow other files (or links) with names of the form

       xy/z{38}.EXTENSION

   where for every EXTENSION the file's content would be the EXTENSION
   representation of the file xy/z{38} . For every representation type
   EXTENSION there should be procedures to derive the file xy/z{38}
   from the name xy/z{38}.EXTENSION and vice-versa (assuming that the
   representation type EXTENSION cares about the contents of file
   xy/z{38}).

Let me give two examples:

    all the files in the object database of git-0.04 are just fine, they
    satisfy axiom (*)

    the name of every file xy/z{38}  in the git-0.5 data base should be
    changed to xy/z{38}.g assuming that we will use EXTENSION g as the
    git representation type. The conversion algorithms would be:

        cat-file `cat-file -t xyz{38}` xyz{38}  to obtain the contents
        represented by xy/z{38}.g whose sha1 is xyz{38}

        and a utility program has to be written to check whether a given
        file F, is a valid contents as far as git is concerned and in
        case it is compute its sha1 sum xyz{38} and also comute the file
        the file xy/z{38}.g .

So, what are the advantages of this further complication? I see these ones:

   git is separated from the idea of sha1 addressable contents, which
   indeed is an idea larger than git itself. This same or similar
   addressing schemes can (and most probably will) be applied to other
   contents besides SCMs. An example would be a digital library of
   scientific papers in pdf together with its OAI compliant meta data
   (don't bother if you are not familiar with these terms, it is just
   an example and I am sure you are able to come up with many other
   examples where a sha1 addressable data base would be interesting)

   all these uses could share common backup schemes where axiom (*)
   would be enforced. One could think of a shared p2p database of
   repositories of sha1 addressed contents of all kinds. This might be
   important because, in general, the contents of xyz{38} cannot be
   reconstructed from its name. The way to defend against file system
   corruption is replication. Why not share these backup databases?

   it would be easier to experiment with other compression schemes or
   other proposals for meta data in git itself.

   it would be easier to experiment with the factorization of common
   chunks of contents, an idea very close to the secret of rsync's
   amazing efficiency.

Well, that's the proposal. I would be happy to hear comments!

Cheers,

Imre Simon

PS: the way it is, the git-0.5 README file is inconsistent. The naming
change is not reflected in the README file which in many places states
that the sha1 sum of file xy/z{38} is xyz{38}.
