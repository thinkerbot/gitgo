My pleasure.  I am currently not that interested in toilet part

to yours is no problem for me.  Currently I see your HEAD is at

I'm actually perfectly happy to merge your SCM layer too eventually, but 
I'm nervous at this point.  Especially while people are discussing some 
SCM options that I'm personally very leery of, and think that may make 
sense for others, but that I personally distrust.

I'm really really hoping I'd use cogito, and that it ends up being just 
one project. In particular, I'm hoping that in a few days, I'll have done 
enough plumbing that I don't even care any more, and then I'd not even 
maintain a tree of my own. 

I'm really not that much of an SCM guy. I detest pretty much all SCM's out
there, and while it's been interesting to do 'git', I've done it because I
was forced to, and because I really wanted to put _my_ needs and opinions
first in an SCM, and see how that works. That's why I've been so adamant
about having a "philosophy", because otherwise I'd probably just end up
with yet another SCM that I'd despise.

So for me, the "optimal" situation really ends up that you guys end up as
the maintainers. I don't even _want_ to maintain it, although I'd be more
than happy to be part of the engineering team. I just want to mark out the
direction well enough and get it to a point where I can _use_ it, that I
feel like I'm done.

But before I can do that, I need to feel like I can live with the end 
result. The only missing part is merges, and I think you and Junio are 
getting pretty close (with Daniel's parent finder, Junio's merger etc).

Hi.

The variable is '$patchfifo', not '$pathfifo'. Adding the missing 'c'
will remove the stray pipes that have been left in /tmp.

My typo it seems - should be exists.  Basically (especially for
gittrack.sh) it will add all files changed between the trees to either
the add or remove queue if this is not done.  This is because it will
just add (say git track linus; git track pasky) the git*.sh files that
is missing in the linus tree (or gitrm.sh if in reverse) although they
are already present there.  So we need to check if the file exists in
the destination tree before we git{add,rm}.sh it - if it do exists, then
its ok to gitrm.sh it, if it does not, it is ok to gitadd.sh it.

The other problem is also that if you keep switching, it will add each
file multiple times to the add/rm queue.  This is a bug with
git{add,rm}.sh which do not check the queue if the file is already
there, and it also add a file even if it is already in the cache - so it
probably need the same type of fix.  I will send a patch when we get how
we check if a file is already in the cache resolved.

Like I said in the patch, it might be better to add support low-level
side (don't know if we can have ls-tree return true/false on file basis,
else add a new tool?).


Thanks,

You need it in order to do further merges.

Because that second merge needs the first merge to work well. The first 
merge might have had some small differences that ended up auto-merging (or 
even needing some manual help from you). The second time you sync, there 
migth be some more automatic merging. And so on.

If you don't keep track of the incremental merges, you end up with one 
really _difficult_ merge that may not be mergable at all. Not 
automatically, and perhaps not even with help.

So in order to keep things mergable, you need to not diverge. And the 
intermediate merges are the "anchor-points" for the next merge, keeping 
the divergences minimal. 

I'm personally convinced that one of the reasons CVS is a pain to merge is 
obviously that it doesn't do a good job of finding parents, but also 
exactly _because_ it makes merges so painful that people wait longer to do 
them, so you never end up fixing the simple stuff. In contrast, if you
have all these small merges going on all the time, the hope is that 
there's never any really painful nasty "final merge".

So you're right - the small merges do end up cluttering up the revision 
history. But it's a small price to pay if it means that you avoid having 
the painful ones.

Nope. In fact, to some degree git will need this even _more_, since the
git merger is likely to be _weaker_ than BK, and thus more easily
confused.

I do believe that BK has these things for the same reason.
