Shrug, we shouldn't need help from the kernel for something like this.  git as 
a database hits worst case scenarios for almost every FS.

We've got:

1) subdirectories with lots of files
2) wasted space for tiny files
3) files that are likely to be accessed together spread across the whole disk

One compromise for SCM use would be one packed file per commit, with an index 
that lets us quickly figure out which commit has a particular version of a 
given file.  My hack gets something close to that (broken into 32k chunks for 
no good reason), and the index to find a given file is just the git directory 
tree.

But my code does hide the fact that we're packing things from most of the git 
interfaces.  So I can almost keep a straight face while claiming to be true 
to the original git design...almost.  The whole setup is far from perfect, 
but it is one option for addressing points 2 & 3 above.

did you compensate for the renamed hashes? Didn't you before update from
some very old git-pasky version?

Actually, did you do that git init _after_ the unsuccessful pull, or
before?

Duh. The remote branch always grabs the HEAD over there; you don't need
to care about the various branches over there, and you really do not
*want* to care. Actually I might add some ^branchname to the rsync URL,
to be able to refer to particular branches inside of the repository.

Yes.

You never work directly on the remote branch. Ever. That's what this
tracking stuff is for; you set up a local branch which follows the
remote one.

Otherwise, you fork to two trees, one is remote branch, second is local
branch, and you do git pull remotebranch in the second. You are in
trouble now. Also, if you do some local commit on the remote branch,
what would happen? This kind of stuff is why I decided that you just
cannot work on remote branches directly.

Perhaps it would be useful to have some "command classes" (with at least
cg-*-(add|ls|rm)), like:

	cg-branch-ls
	cg-remote-rm
	cg-tag-add

I don't know what do you mean here.
