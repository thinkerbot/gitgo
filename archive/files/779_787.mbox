I just stumbled across this page, dated 2003, which foreshadows a couple
of the decisions Linus has made for git:

  http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/scm/vc.txt

Here are the parts that particularly caught my eye:

"what's so special about files ?" where the author suggests that
existing SCM systems are so blinded by the tradition of file orientation
that they can't see that there might be alternatives.

"As a goodie we can even note that moving a file inside the hierarchy
has become exactly similar as moving a code statement." where the author
recognizes that renames are merely a special case of code moves.

His implementation ideas are quite different from git, but I thought it
was pretty cool to find that someone was thinking about these ideas a
couple years ago.

  Hello,

  so I've implemented "true" git merge in git-pasky, using core git's
merging capabilities. It seems to even work. :-)

  I tested it briefly, and even did one non-conflicting and one
conflicting merge with Linus with this, but I'd like to hear your
comments and possibly more testing before releasing it.

  To get the lastest git-pasky, get the tarball at

	http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git

unpack, build, install, do

	git pull

rebuild and reinstall.


  The semantics is trivial (and it might get changed so that you would
do git update instead of git pull at most of places). If you don't have
a given GIT repository ready yet, do

	git init rsync://example.com/repo

in a new directory. It is by default tracking, therefore if you do

	git pull

anytime later, git merge will be automatically invoked. If you want to
prevent this, do

	git track

which will untrack your tree; the remote branch you were tracking is
called "origin", shall you want to pull/merge it later. You might want
to also merge with someone else. Do

	git addremote elsewhere rsync://example.org/another
	git pull elsewhere
	git merge elsewhere

(Note that merge won't pull automatically; you must do that on your own
if you want to pull.)


If the merge didn't succeed and you have conflicts, don't panic. The
merge told you about the conflicts, you can also do

	git diff

to see the changes, you'll probably spot the conflict markers. Resolve
the conflicts and then simply do

	git commit

to commit the pending merge.


Now you decided to do a little bit of parallel development and stick
your patches not ready for 2.6.12 to a separate tree. That's fine, do

	git fork experimental ~/linux-2.6.experimental

and get some coffee. (It takes about 8 minutes here, but I think git
isn't at fault - it is probably all spent in

	read-tree $(tree-id)
	checkout-cache -a
	update-cache --refresh

and you pretty much need to call that.)

Then, do some work there, syncing with your main tree periodically:

	git merge master

(that's how your first init'd branch is called). You decide to make it
more fun for Linus and push your experimental stuff into your master
tree. Fine, cd there and do

	git merge experimental

and there you go!


Have fun,

Alright, let's try some small i2c and w1 patches...

Could you merge with:
	kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/i2c-2.6.git/

It contains 4 small patches, 2 i2c and 2 w1 bugfixes, diffstat is
below, I'll figure out how to send the individual patches later.

thanks,

... what about names?  When somebody other than connectivity
checker walks a tree, it would be more likely than not that 
it wants to know what each entry is called, wound't it?

I can get the type of the object, either tree or blob, from
tree->object.type, so I do not think the single-bit are needed.

Instead, how about something simpler like this?

    struct tree {
        struct object object; /* the tree node itself as an object */
        unsigned child_nr;
        unsigned child_alloc;
        struct {
            struct object *object;
            char *name;
        } **child;
    };

The tree->child[n].object would point at the same object as one
of the object_list elements in tree->object.refs chain (i.e. you
do not need to read the same object twice).  Before the tree is
parsed, tree->child would be NULL.  You do not need child_alloc
if the intended use of this API is only parsing existing object
tree.  Otherwise keep that and realloc tree->child as needed.

Wouldn't this be more readable, short and sweet?

    merge "$src2" "$orig" "$src1" || {
        echo Leaving conflict merge in $src2 && exit 1
    }
    cp "$src2" "$4" && exec update-cache --add -- "$4"

You did not want subshell so I just changed the () pair to the
{} pair, and while I was at it I folded the "&& exit 0" into the
last command before it, which should be better.  You'd want to
know if update-cache --add failed for whatever reason.

Yes; just add the name to the tree_entry_list.

You still need the mode bit (executable or not); also, the current code
can't create an object without being told in advance what it is, so you
need to use the directory bit.

I think the linked list is easier to deal with, and matches the other code
better.

The object code handles causing lookup_* to return the same object every
time, so this isn't an issue. Note that each struct object has to be
embedded in a struct <type> of the appropriate type, which means that we
can only create a struct object by either knowing what type it is supposed
to be or actually reading the file to find out what it actually is.

I pulled the tar.bz2 and did make:
gcc -g -O3 -Wall -o merge-cache merge-cache.o libgit.a libgit.a -lssl -lz
gcc -g -O3 -Wall   -c -o unpack-file.o unpack-file.c
gcc -g -O3 -Wall -o unpack-file unpack-file.o libgit.a libgit.a -lssl -lz
make: commit-id: Command not found
Generating gitversion.sh...

Is this bad?

My automatic pull this morning produced the following messages, which
seem to indicate that something's up with git pull now.
