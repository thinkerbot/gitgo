[many files patched]
patching file mm/mmap.c
patching file net/bridge/br_sysfs_if.c
patching file scripts/ver_linux
----------------------^^^^^^^^^
Hey, that's my patch!  Last...and least.
But perhaps a progress bar right about here might be
a good thing for the terminally impatient.

real    3m54.909s
user    0m14.835s
sys     0m10.587s

4 minutes might be long enough to cause some folks to lose hope.

Correct me if I am wrong, but the right way to do this is to set the
hostname to just that - the hostname, and add 'domain foo.com'
to /etc/resolv.conf.  Then you should get something like (for say
www1.foo.com):

 $ hostname
www1
 $ dnsdomainname
foo.com
 $ hostname -f
www1.foo.com

I know for some buggy software the workaround was to set the hostname to
the FQDN, but that is really just a kludge, and the software should
rather be fixed (had to patch postfix some time back for instance).

I'm wondering if doing

if [ "$(show-diff)" ]; then
	git diff | git apply
else
	checkout-cache -f -a
fi

would actually buy us some time; or, how common is it for people to have
no local changes whatsoever, and whether relative slowdown of additional
show-diff to git diff would actually matter.

The glibc documentation blows for this, but what getdomainname comes
from uname(2), not from any DNS-related configuration.  Debian only
ever sets this if you're using NIS.

There's no real great way to get the current hostname; a lot of
applications do a reverse DNS lookup on the primary network interface,
with appropriate handwaving to define primary.

Easiest might be to punt to hostname --fqdn, or an equivalent to its
algorithm - which appears to be fetch the hostname from uname, do a DNS
lookup on that, and a reverse DNS lookup on the result.

But doesn't this require assuming the distribution of MD5 is uniform,
and don't the papers finding collisions in less show it's not? So, your
birthday-argument for calculating the probability wouldn't apply, because
it rests on the assumption MD5 is uniform, and it isn't.

For example, say most people are married in June, get pregnant, and
there are more births around March, 9 months later, than in other
months. Then if you are born in March you have a higher chance of seeing
a collision of your birthday with someone else's. The same is true for
someone else born in March too, and this makes the chances of seeing a
collision for the whole function higher.

Well, somehow Gentoo sets this up properly, and I'm not using NIS.  Hm,
my SuSE boxes on the other hand...

Ick.  Let's stick with Linus's patch for now...

Well, the real operations took only 15 seconds. What kind of horribe 
person are you, that you don't have all of the kernel in your disk cache 
already? Shame on you.

Or was the 4 minutes for downloading all the objest too?

Anyway, it looks like you are using pasky's scripts, and the old 
"patch-based" upgrade at that. You certainly will _not_ see the

	[many files patched]
	patching file mm/mmap.c
	..

if you use a real git merge. That's probable be the real problem here.

Real merges have no patches taking place _anywhere_. And they take about 
half a second. Doing an "update" of your tree should _literally_ boil down 
to

	#
	# "repo" needs to point to the repo we update from
	#
	rsync -avz --ignore-existing $repo/objects/. .git/objects/.
	rsync -L $repo/HEAD .git/NEW_HEAD || exit 1
	read-tree -m $(cat .git/NEW_HEAD) || exit 1
	checkout-cache -f -a
	update-cache --refresh
	mv .git/NEW_HEAD .git/HEAD

and if it does anything else, it's literally broken. Btw, the above does
need my "read-tree -m" thing which I committed today.

(CAREFUL: the above is not a good script, because it _will_ just overwrite 
all your old contents with the stuff you updated to. You should thus not 
actually use something like this, but a "git update" should literally end 
up doing the above operations in the end, and just add proper checking).

And if that takes 4 minutes, you've got problems.

Just say no to patches. 

		Linus

PS: If you want a clean tree without any old files or anything else, for
that matter, you can then do a "show-files -z --others | xargs -0 rm", but
be careful: that will blow away _anything_ that wasn't revision controlled
with git. So don't blame me if your pr0n collection is gone afterwards.
