Actually I'm not sure that's true. Let's consider the two main users of
this information.

Firstly, because it's what I've been playing with: to list a given
file's revision history, I currently work with its filename -- walk the
commit objects, inspecting the tree and selecting those commits where
the file has changed. If my filename is 'fs/jffs2/inode.c' then I can
immediately skip over a commit where the 'fs' entry in the top-level
tree is identical to that in the parent, or I can skip a commit where
the 'jffs2' entry in the 'fs' subtree is identical to the parent... it's
all done on filename, and the {parent, entry} tuple wouldn't help much
here; I'd probably have to convert back to a filename anyway.

Secondly, there's merges. I've paid less attention to these (see mail 5
minutes ago) but I think they'd end up operating on the rename
information in a very similar way. To find a common ancestor for a given
file,, we want to track its name as it changed during history; at that
point it's all string compares.

Maybe you (or the group) should standardize on a way to 'extend' the 
commit 'object' in terms of:

the layer1 (git) header for commit object is defined as such-and-such
the layer2 (scm or other) header for commit object is defined as 
such-and-such

Much the way network protocols stack on top of each other.  If a 
standard way of stacking is defined, then it could be much cleaner for 
future implementors to understand a 'new' stacking protocol, and it will 
make the scm-level extensions easier to discuss it terms of their own 
'layer'.

I imagine quite a few folks expect something not entirely unlike an SCM
to emerge from these current efforts. Moreover, Petr's 'git' scripts
wrap your "filesystem" plumbing to that very end.

To avoid confusion, I think it would be better to distinguish the two
layers, perhaps by calling the low-level plumbing... 'gitfs', of course.
