hey, it's a 2 weeks old project, but it's certainly one of the 
fastest-growing projects i've ever seen: it has so much steam that it's 
scary :) It seems that a true emergency focused a massive, spontaneous 
concentration of OSS development power.

Hi,

I uploaded a first draft of wit to
http://www.absolutegiganten.org/wit

Right now it's a minimal web interface on top of git. Unpack it, make
sure you've got at least Python 2.3, optionally install c2html, adjust
config.py and start from the root with
$ PYTHONPATH=. python git/web/wit.py
Point your browser to http://localhost:8090

I append my random notes about this thing:

* wit was built with git 075930771b68528ae13630375df2fe634e9ac610 which
is 2-3 days old, it's untested with newer gits, it's functional for me

* philosophy: provide a git repository browser and show the basic types
of git under appropriate URIs like
/commit/head, /commit/<sha1>, /tree/head, /tree/<sha1>, /blob/<sha1>
and encode operations in URIs like /tree/<sha1>/tarball

* the html is probably invalid and looks like crap

* it's just sitting on top of git because that's the least moving part
of git right now (hah), no usage of git-pasky yet

* it's done with quixote 2.0 which is included

* don't use it on a kernel tree or you will experience slowness beyond
your wildest dreams

* it doesn't use revision.h or other lighning fast C goodies until the
dust settles down

* it'll probably eat your dog and falls apart when blowing at it

* I happen to think that it's a nice start

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.

Greetings,



				Christian

Absolutely! I'm totally impressed with the progress so far.
