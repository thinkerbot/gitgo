The interesting bit you snipped was the part where you said you do not
know how to get dnsdomainname to work properly, and that I answered.
Why this other crap about how 90% of the world does it?

PS: If you have later tools, setting hostname to the FQDN and then still
adding 'domain' to resolv.conf seems to do the right thing, although it
did not some time back (and was why I said the bit about hostname only
containing the hostname, else you got something like 'hostname -f'
returning 'www1.foo.com.foo.com) ...

Yes, I was using a very recent version of the pasky tools,
I had created the repo this morning with git init YOUR_RSYC_URL_FOR_LINUX-2.6.
I did time git pull origin and watched the fur fly.

Then, the flurry of patching file blah messages, followed by a rather 
pregnant pause after the last patching message.

I wasn't complaining about the 4 minutes, just the lack of feedback
during the majority of that time.  And most of it was after the last
patching file message.

OK.  I may try some of this tomorrow from work, where I have a fat pipe.

I'm on dialup from home, and I suspect not very many folks want to hear
the sad tale of how long it takes to get the kernel over 56k dialup.

That must've been the update-cache.

Well, you can listen to your strained disk crepitating direly.
