For the record, mostly... (this is how it already is in git-pasky-0.5)

Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 02:07:36AM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

I killed them both for good.

I've removed git branch, removed the possibility for git update to
switch branches and renamed git update to git seek. You can do

	git seek git-pasky-0.1

and examine stuff, but your tree is also blocked at the same time - git
won't let you commit, merge and such. By doing

	git seek
or
	git seek master

you return back to your branch (assuming its name is master).

I think git fork is after all good enough for branching and it is the
clean way. Shall there be a big demand for it, it should be minimal
hassle to implement 'git switch', which would do that.

No, this employer seems quite sane :)
However, irc connections are as "real" as a kernel changelog message to
a lot of people.

Ok, then why display it as one?  Seriously, it doesn't really bother me,
just added it as I thought others would need it.  I know the "shortlog"
program can pick the real names out of the Signed-off-by: lines.

But I'll wait for Russell to wake up and start quoting the proper EU
privacy laws that he feels causes him to be forced to obfuscate his
email addresses in the changelog commits (as he did for the bk ones.)

thanks,

I'd be actually pretty interested in knowing about such laws; I think I
missed it on LKML when it went through. And after all, being an EU
citizen myself...
