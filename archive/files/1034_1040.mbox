That's _exactly_ what it's doing. It's waiting for you to write a commit 
message.

Something like

	This is my initial commit of Hello World!
	^D

will make it happy.

Alternatively, you can certainly just write your message beforehand with 
an editor and just pipe it into commit-tree.

I keep thinking perversely that we need something as obtuse as possible
in the unix tradition, but easy to type... git requires that the fingers
move off the home row...

how about "asdf" or "jkl"?  :)

cg is singularly uncomfortable to type. I think that's why it isn't 
commonly used.....

Grm. Cg is also name of some scary NVidia thing, and cog is GNOME
Configurator. CGT are Chimera Grid Tools, but I think we can clash
with those - at least *I* wouldn't mind. ;-)
