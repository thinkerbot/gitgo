that's what i loosely meant under 'manageability problems'.

I mentioned one solution earlier: to make the repository object an 
immutable file (the +i flag on the inode) - it really wants to be 
immutable after all. That would solve a whole range of 'accidental 
corruption' issues.

Another solution (suggested by Christer Weinigel) was to enforce 
immutability by making it owned by another user/group (git:git or 
whatever).

but having a binary compressed format is 'soft immutability', done 
cleverly.

I think abusing the immutable bit quickly will decend into the same 
rathole which makes u-w often useless.  u-w will actually be preserved 
by more tools -- simply because they know about it -- than +i.

Either which way, it feels to me that this idea has already been ruled 
out, so it's probably pointless to keep debating just exactly what we're 
not actually going to do.
