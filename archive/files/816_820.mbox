This is certainly uninteresting for source code repositories
but for people who manage repositories of rsyncable binary
packages this would save a lot of space, bandwidth and
cpu time (compared to rsync because the scanning phase is
not necessary anymore).=20

Is there a way to check out a tree without changing the mtime of any
files that you have already checked out and which are the same as the
version you are checking out?  It seems that checkout-cache -a doesn't
overwrite any existing files, and checkout-cache -f -a overwrites all
files and gives them the current mtime.  This is a pain if you are
using make and your tree is large (like, for instance, the linux
kernel :), because it means that after a checkout-cache -f -a you get
to recompile everything.

Paul.

Corollary: why aren't we storing mtime in the tree objects?

is there any 'export commit as patch' support in git-pasky? I didnt find 
any such command (maybe it got added meanwhile), so i'm using the 'ge' 
hack below.

e.g. i typically look at commits via 'git log', and then when i see 
something interesting, i look at the commit via the 'ge' script. E.g.  
"ge 834f6209b22af2941a8640f1e32b0f123c833061" done in the kernel tree 
will output a particular commit's header and the patch.

	Ingo

#!/bin/bash

if [ $# != 1 ]; then
 echo 'ge <commit-ID>'
 exit -1
fi
TREE1=$(cat-file commit 2>/dev/null $1 | head -4 | grep ^tree | cut -d' ' -f2)
if [ "$TREE1" = "" ]; then echo 'ge <commit-ID>'; exit -1; fi
PARENT=$(cat-file commit 2>/dev/null $1 | head -4 | grep ^parent | cut -d' ' -f2)
if [ "$PARENT" = "" ]; then echo 'ge <commit-ID>'; exit -1; fi
TREE2=$(cat-file commit 2>/dev/null $PARENT | head -4 | grep ^tree | cut -d' ' -f2)
if [ "$TREE2" = "" ]; then echo 'ge <commit-ID>'; exit -1; fi

cat-file commit $1
echo
git diff -r $TREE2:$TREE1
