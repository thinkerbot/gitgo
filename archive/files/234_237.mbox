Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 15, 2005 at 08:44:02PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Actually, I wanted to ask about this. :-)

So, I assume that you don't want to merge my "SCM layer" (which is
perfectly fine by me). However, I also apply plenty of patches
concerning the "core git" - be it portability, leak fixes, argument
parsing fixes and so on.

Would it be of any benefit if I maintained two trees, one with just your
core git but what I merge (I think I'd call this branch git-pb), and one
with my git-pasky (to be renamed to Cogito) layer. I'd then put the
"core git" changes to the git-pb branch and pull from it to the Cogito
branch regularily, but it should be safe for you to pull from it too.

In fact, in that case I might even end up entirely separating the Cogito
tools from the core git and distributing them independently.

BTW, just out of interest, are you personally planning to use Cogito for
your kernel and sparse (and possibly even git) work, or will you stay
with your lowlevel plumbing for that?

Thanks,

--

Or if one does not care about space,  and simply want's speed,  add another
layer of indirection - a flattened container object which has hashses as
normal,  then as it's content simply has the 'chunk list object' and the
'chunk objects' concatenated.

It's then a per user / database as to if the flattened objects,  or the
heirarcal objects are storred locally.

The best way to shup somebody up is always to just do it, and say "hey, I 
told you so". It's hard to argue with numbers.
