Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 18, 2005 at 01:31:36AM CEST, I got a letter
where David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org> told me that...

I think this is bad, bad, bad. If you don't keep around all the
_commits_, you get into all sorts of troubles - when merging, when doing
git log, etc. And the commits themselves are probably actually pretty
small portion of the thing. I didn't do any actual measurement but I
would be pretty surprised if it would be much more than few megabytes of
data for the kernel history.

Of course an entirely different thing are _trees_ associated with those
commits. As long as you stay with a simple three-way merge, you
basically never want to look at trees which aren't heads and which you
don't specifically request to look at. And the trees and what they carry
inside is the main bulk of data.

What's wrong with the contents of the glibc-kernheaders package? Can you
file specific bugs if you're having problems?

In the long run, the answer is to convince Linus that we _really_ need
the kernel to have a set of header files defining the ABI which are fit
for public consumption, rather than having a horrid mix of private and
exportable bits throughout the contents of the include/ directory. 

In the meantime, some poor mug has to clean the crap up and try to make
something suitable to live in /usr/include/linux -- and unfortunately at
the moment for Fedora that someone is me :)

Unless git is doing something with kernel-private headers that it
shouldn't, this probably wants to be discussed elsewhere -- most likely
in Bugzilla.
