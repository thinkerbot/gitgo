{"title":"Notify when git fails","tags":["open"],"date":"2010-01-20T18:16:35Z","author":"Simon Chiang <simon.chiang@pinnacol.com>","type":"issue","content":"This is surprisingly difficult given the way Grit executes commands.  Sometimes it goes to git, sometimes it goes to internal commands.  When it does go to git, it executes via Open3, which does not set $? (see http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1287).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the stderr output is not returned, although it can be logged (unfortunately the logger is global and therefore sketchy to monitor).  What to do then?  How do you tell when a git command failed?\r\n\r\n","at":"2647402c131e702b0a87eb61a124d0839b8d0bb0","state":"open"}
